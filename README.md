## Introduction

Launch is a simple boilerplate project to help reduce the set up time of new static web projects.

## Get Started 💾

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

```
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

2. Clone the Launch repository into the current folder.

```
git clone git@github.com:user/my-project.git .
```

3. Install build and application dependencies.

```
bower install
npm install
```

4. Build and serve the application (This will start a local server and point a browser to the correct address).

```
gulp
```

5. Get started! Make changes to the `index.html` file and the browser will refresh automatically once the application has been rebuilt.
